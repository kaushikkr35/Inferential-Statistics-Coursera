# Inferential-Statistics-Coursera
Repo for code created as a part of the Inferential Statistics course offered by Duke University on Coursera. This course is part 2 of a 5 course series on Statistics that is offered on Coursera. 

For my final project on this course - my research question was,
"Do people with different political preferences think that we are spending too little money on improving and protecting the environment?"

Here's my reasoning behind choosing this question - This is a topic that comes up often when debating climate change and there seems to be an uninformed opinion that a certain subset of the population seem that support one political party, seem to have no regard for the environment whatsoever. I prefer having data by my side, rather than arguing anecdotally - and that is the reason why I am performing this analysis.

I have used the GSS data that was provided for the final assignment to gain statistical inference on my research question.
